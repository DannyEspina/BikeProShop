          and selling bicycles. Originally from Chile, Miguel loved riding his bicycle
          on the mountainside of chile for miles with his friends and family. In 1985 he moved to
          Miami to live the American Dream along with his family. Since then he began learning
          his trade by respoking wheels after wheels along with his 3 brothers
          in a small home in Miami. In 1995 he opened his first bicycle shop called Best Bike
